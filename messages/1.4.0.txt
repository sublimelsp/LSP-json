=> 1.4.0

Breaking:

 - If you have customized the `userSchemas` object in LSP-json.sublime-settings, it now takes an
   array of objects with keys `fileMatch` and `uri` instead of `fileMatch` and `url` (`uri` instead of `url`).

Feature:

 - Implement support for packages defining `sublime-package.json` file to define schema for its settings.
