=> 1.6.0

Breaking:

 - The "userSchemas" setting that was part of the root configuration file before is now part of the "settings".
   If you have customized "userSchemas" option, please move it inside the "settings" object:

  {
    "setting": {
      "userSchemas": {
        // ...
      }
    }
  }
